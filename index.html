                <h2>Applied AI in Higher Education: A Practical Workshop</h2>
                
                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                <p>Welcome to this hands-on workshop on using Applied AI to support your teaching and learning. The tools available to us are evolving rapidly, and our goal today is to provide a structured, supportive environment for you to gain practical skills and critically evaluate these technologies from the perspective of your specific disciplines.</p>

                <h3>Session Goal: A Core Set of Skills for All</h3>
                <p>Our objective is not to make everyone an AI expert, but to ensure all staff leave with a common baseline of skills. By the end of this session, you will have had hands-on experience with:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Image Generation &amp; Bias:</strong> Using Microsoft Copilot to generate images and, crucially, evaluating them for the professional and ethical biases relevant to your field.</li>
                    <li><strong>Source-Grounded AI:</strong> Using NotebookLM to summarise academic texts and create audio resources, understanding <em>why</em> it is safer than general AI for academic work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom AI Agents:</strong> Using the specialist Copilot agents we have designed, such as the <strong>Academic Feedback Assistant</strong>, to support your specific academic tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student Support:</strong> Reflecting on how to guide students towards responsible and effective use of these tools.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>A Pathway for Everyone</h3>
                <p>We recognise that colleagues are joining with diverse levels of experience. To make this session effective, we will <em>not</em> be using a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Diagnostic Poll:</strong> You will be able to identify your current comfort level with generative AI (Novice, Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced).</li>
                    <li><strong>Differentiated Pathways:</strong> Based on your answer, you will follow a specific pathway but can change during the session if you feel that would be beneficial:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Novices</strong> will use a detailed, step-by-step guided worksheet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Beginners</strong> will use a "problem and hint" method to support them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intermediate/Advanced</strong> staff will quickly review the core tasks before moving to high-level challenges focused on critique and design for their disciplines.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>This model ensures that everyone is appropriately challenged and supported. Please ask questions at any time; this session is for experimentation and learning.</p>
